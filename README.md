===============================
The game starts when you open index.html in a browser. 

The goal of the game is to get as many points as possible:

Player reaches the water and gets 3 points.
Player lands on a star and gets 1 point.
Player collides with a bug and loses one point.

Use the arrow keys to move the player on the screen.

My Experience: 

This was my first time using objects and JavaScript. The project was very challenging. At first, I had no idea how to even start and I spent a few days looking at a blank screen. 

After using the videos and resources at Udacity, I eventually understood how to use the Chrome debugger, the concept of closures, and scope. I also found that breaking up this project into a bunch of little problems was also helpful. All in all I thought this was a great project and I learned quite a bit. 

Thank you to Udacity for their office hours, forums, and live personal chat sessions; they were immensely helpful during the duration of this project.
